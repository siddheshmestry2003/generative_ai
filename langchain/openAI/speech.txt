Good morning everyone,

It’s truly a pleasure to stand before you today. We often dream big — about success, achievements, and making a mark in this world. But too often, we forget that every big dream begins with something very small.

Think about it — the tallest tree was once a seed. The biggest company started in someone’s garage. And the strongest person you know once struggled to take their first step.

What makes a difference is not how big your start is, but that you start. Every small effort, every small step, every small improvement counts. Success is not a sudden explosion — it’s a quiet journey of persistence, built day by day.

Many people wait for the “perfect time” or the “right opportunity.” But the truth is — there’s never a perfect moment. The best time to begin is now. Take that first step. Write that first line. Learn that first skill. You’ll stumble, you’ll make mistakes, but you’ll also grow.

So, let’s promise ourselves today — to stop waiting, and start doing. To take that one small step toward our goals. Because when you look back one day, you’ll realize that those small steps were the beginning of something extraordinary.

Thank you.
